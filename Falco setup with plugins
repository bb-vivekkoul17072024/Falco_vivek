Here are the commands that will be used to setup falco

->The command below can be used to setup falco with an output integration of slack to receive alerts on slack.
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm repo update
helm install falco -n falco falcosecurity/falco \
  --set falcosidekick.enabled=true \
  --set falcosidekick.webui.enabled=true \
  --set auditLog.enabled=true \
  --set falco.jsonOutput=true \
  --set falco.fileOutput.enabled=true \
  --create-namespace \
  --set falcosidekick.config.slack.webhookurl="Slack webhook link"
Find the webhook link on slack:-Create channel->Create app->integration->Search incoming webhook->set the channel name->generate the webhook link and save it for
future use.

Now to setup plugins for falco:
Plugin1:K8s audit:The k8saudit-eks plugin in Falco is used to monitor Kubernetes audit logs in an Amazon EKS cluster. Since EKS control plane logs are not directly
accessible, Falco integrates with CloudWatch, where these audit logs are forwarded. The plugin retrieves logs from CloudWatch and processes Kubernetes API events
— such as pod creation, secret access, or ConfigMap changes — to detect suspicious activity based on Falco rules.
Steps:-
Create a yaml file that contains the configuration for the setup of the k8s-audit-plugin you will find it in the offical website of falco also.
Provide necessary Roles to your cluster if the setup is on eks.
After all this execte this command below.
command:
-> helm install falco-k8saudit-eks -n falco falcosecurity/falco -f ./filename.yaml
After this u will receive the updates on your terminal,Now there will be individual pods of the falco-k8s-audit and they will run as deployment as they will get
the logs from the cloudwatch.
Now to recive these alerts on slack also upgrade your helm chart by running the command below:
command:
helm upgrade  falco-k8saudit-eks -n falco falcosecurity/falco
  --set falcosidekick.config.slack.webhookurl="samewebhookurl_link" -f ./filename.yaml
make sure that the webhook url is same to receive all the alerts on same channel and set filename as same also that was used to install k8s audit.
After this your k8s audit setup will be done successfully.
