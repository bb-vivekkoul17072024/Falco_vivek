Here we will be editing the same values.yaml file that we used for k8s-audit Plugin to setup the cloudtrail plugin.
Now the cloudtrail plugin will also run as deployment through k8s-audit pods.\
Firstly ensure you have added the cloudtrail plugins in the yaml file.
Here is the helm command below to use the updated yaml file and update k8s-audit pods respectively.
command:
helm install falco-aws-cloudtrail falcosecurity/falco -n falco -f cloudtrail.yaml
